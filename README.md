QolPoint - A quality of life mac app
-----------

QolPoint is an app that lets you execute terminal commands and open files from a simple GUI, accesible through a keyboard shortcut. It comes with many useful commands built-in, like letting you create **any kind of file in Finder**, **showing you your current wifi password** or **ejecting all disks**. You cam also add your own commands, and can sort all of these into folders.

These commands can be run by clicking on their assigned button, or through a keyboard shortcut.

***DEFAULT KEYBOARD SHORTCUT: CMD+E***

***--- How it Works ---***

The main part of the app is a dock-like GUI that contains the buttons that you select. You can configure what is shown in settings, which is reachable from the menu bar or by clicking on the **Settings** button.

***--- Main Settings ---***
	
Set the keybind for showing/hiding app in:

	Main Settings > Main Shortcut

and press the keybind you would like to bind it to.

Reset all buttons and saves through:

	Main Settings > Reset buttons > Confirm reset
	
Export button saves (copies them to clipboard):

	Main Settings > Copy button saves

Import button saves:

	Main Settings > (paste saves into textbox) > Import buttons

You need to go back to the main menu for changes to take effect.
